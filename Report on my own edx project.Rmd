# Abstract
The data describe the problem of high energy (higher than 10^4 J) seismic bumps forecasting in a coal mine. Data come from two of longwalls located in a Polish coal mine.

# Introduction
## Data set Information

Mining activity was and is always connected with the occurrence of dangers which are commonly called 
mining hazards. A special case of such threat is a seismic hazard which frequently occurs in many 
underground mines. Seismic hazard is the hardest detectable and predictable of natural hazards and in 
this respect it is comparable to an earthquake. More and more advanced seismic and seismoacoustic 
monitoring systems allow a better understanding rock mass processes and definition of seismic hazard 
prediction methods. Accuracy of so far created methods is however far from perfect. Complexity of 
seismic processes and big disproportion between the number of low-energy seismic events and the number 
of high-energy phenomena (e.g. > 10^4J) causes the statistical techniques to be insufficient to predict 
seismic hazard. Therefore, it is essential to search for new opportunities of better hazard prediction, 
also using machine learning methods. In seismic hazard assessment data clustering techniques can be 
applied (Lesniak A., Isakow Z.: Space-time clustering of seismic events and hazard assessment in the 
Zabrze-Bielszowice coal mine, Poland. Int. Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Sciences, 46(5), 2009, 
918-928), and for prediction of seismic tremors artificial neural networks are used (Kabiesz, J.: Effect 
of the form of data on the quality of mine tremors hazard forecasting using neural networks. 
Geotechnical and Geological Engineering, 24(5), 2005, 1131-1147). In the majority of applications, the 
results obtained by mentioned methods are reported in the form of two states which are interpreted as 
'hazardous' and 'non-hazardous'. Unbalanced distribution of positive ('hazardous state') and negative 
('non-hazardous state') examples is a serious problem in seismic hazard prediction. Currently used 
methods are still insufficient to achieve good sensitivity and specificity of predictions. In the paper 
(Bukowska M.: The probability of rockburst occurrence in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin area dependent on 
natural mining conditions. Journal of Mining Sciences, 42(6), 2006, 570-577) a number of factors having 
an effect on seismic hazard occurrence was proposed, among other factors, the occurrence of tremors with 
energy > 10^4J was listed. The task of seismic prediction can be defined in different ways, but the main 
aim of all seismic hazard assessment methods is to predict (with given precision relating to time and 
date) of increased seismic activity which can cause a rockburst. In the data set each row contains a 
summary statement about seismic activity in the rock mass within one shift (8 hours). If decision 
attribute has the value 1, then in the next shift any seismic bump with an energy higher than 10^4 J was 
registered. That task of hazards prediction bases on the relationship between the energy of recorded 
tremors and seismoacoustic activity with the possibility of rockburst occurrence. Hence, such hazard 
prognosis is not connected with accurate rockburst prediction. Moreover, with the information about the 
possibility of hazardous situation occurrence, an appropriate supervision service can reduce a risk of 
rockburst (e.g. by distressing shooting) or withdraw workers from the threatened area. Good prediction 
of increased seismic activity is therefore a matter of great practical importance. The presented data 
set is characterized by unbalanced distribution of positive and negative examples. In the data set there 
are only 170 positive examples representing class 1. 

## Arribute Information
1. seismic: result of shift seismic hazard assessment in the mine working obtained by the seismic

4. genergy: seismic energy recorded within previous shift by the most active geophone (GMax) out of 
geophones monitoring the longwall;

('hazardous state'), '0' means that no high energy seismic bumps occurred in the next shift 
('non-hazardous state').
